				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. 
					<p>
					To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. 
				</p>
				
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Mages demolish their foes with arcane incantations. Although they wield powerful offensive spells, mages are fragile and lightly armored, making them particularly vulnerable to close-range attacks. 
			</p>
		<p>
			Wise mages make careful use of their spells to keep their foes at a distance or hold them in place.
			</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Fire</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Fire specialization is fantastic at delivering both burst and sustained damage on a variety of fight types. Fire cleaves extremely efficiently on stacked targets, gaining overall damage without sacrificing any single target at all. 
					</p>
				<p>
					Fire really shines on fights where a multitude of stacked targets all have equal or high priority. Fire has evolved to become a very potent spec at bursting down priority targets as well. Like all Mage specializations, Fire has high mobility and is fantastic at doing encounter specific jobs and baiting mechanics. Between Ice Floes, Blink, and Scorch, high movement encounters have minimal impact on Fire's overall output.

			<h4><b><ins>Frost</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Frost specialization has always excelled at limiting enemy movement while dealing reliable and predictable damage output. Frost has always been a very potent choice for leveling and world content given you can endlessly kite enemies, with a multitude of snares, stuns, and roots combined with damage on the move. 
			</p>
			<p>
					Frost is great at quickly bursting down priority adds, as there are a variety of ways to instantly generate Fingers of Frost to empower your instant cast Ice Lance. Like all Mage specializations, Frost has high mobility and is fantastic at doing encounter specific jobs and baiting mechanics. Between Ice Floes, Shimmer, and a variety of instant cast spells, high movement encounters have minimal impact on Frost's overall output.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Arcane</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Arcane specialization is a great jack of all trades specialization. It continues to provide great burst damage and solid sustained damage on single target encounters, and boasts impressive AoE as well. Arcane is able to instantly apply pressure on new targets, making it a very strong specialization for bursting down priority targets without requiring time to ramp up. 
			</p>
			<p>
					Like all Mage specializations, Arcane has high mobility and is fantastic at doing encounter-specific jobs and baiting mechanics. Between Ice Floes, Displacement, and Blink, high movement encounters have minimal impact on Arcane's overall output. Arcane is also the only Mage specialization with access to Greater Invisibility, making it the strongest Mage specialization to deal with heavy incoming damage.
