				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Paladins stand directly in front of their enemies, relying on heavy armor and healing in order to survive incoming attacks. Whether with massive shields or crushing two-handed weapons, Paladins are able to keep claws and swords from their weaker fellows â€“ or they use healing magic to ensure that they remain on their feet.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Protection</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>As a Protection Paladin, you can expect to perform the role of a solid and reliable tank. In general, your damage intake will be relatively smooth, with many attacks being blocked by your shield or softened by your strong active mitigation. No other tank class has quite the array of tricks up their sleeve that a paladin does.

			<h4><b><ins>Retribution</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>A Retribution paladin smites it's for with Holy Power, building it up and unleading devestating abilities. Retribtuion is a stong single target damage per second (DPS). In terms of area of effect (aoe) damage it does decently.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Holy</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>Holy Paladins specialise on tank and single-target healing, with this being their primary role. They possess a large amount of tools that help them mitigate or avoid damage, both on themselves and on other raid members.
			</p>
			<p>
Holy Paladins lack mobility, and their cooldowns as not as impactful as those of other healing classes (such as Tranquility from Druids or Divine Hymn from Priests).
