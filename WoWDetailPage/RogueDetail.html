				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Rogues often initiate combat with a surprise attack from the shadows, leading with vicious melee strikes. When in protracted battles, they utilize a successive combination of carefully chosen attacks to soften the enemy up for a killing blow. Rogues must take special care when selecting targets so that their combo attacks are not wasted, and they must be conscious of when to hide or flee if a battle turns against them.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Assassination</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Assassination Rogue focuses primarily on dealing damage through the application of lethal poisons and bleed effects. They have a wide array of abilities to deal with a multitude of fight types, but they especially excel at dealing high single target burst damage. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to other Rogue specializations, Assassination also provides a wide array of crowd control utility which can be invaluable in controlling adds. 
			</p>
				<p>	
				Rogues also excel at dealing with abilities that need to be soaked and deal high damage, as they have a variety of defensive tools to mitigate or avoid damage. High personal mobility also makes them excellent at kiting fixates or sticking to mobile targets.

			<h4><b><ins>Outlaw</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Ahoy! Outlaw is a fantastic jack of all trades that can comfortably handle any situation or fight type. Between the three Rogue specializations, Outlaw is by far the most effective in situations involving heavy cleave or area of effect (AoE). While it does not shine as brightly on single target, this spec is most at home when crawling through thick trash packs in dungeons and wading through massive AoE on bosses. 
			</p>
			<p>
					Outlaw has good sustained damage and is great at applying pressure instantly, as it is very unreliant on cooldowns.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Subtlety</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Subtlety Rogues continue to provide strong single-target pressure, and respectable are of effect (AoE) to the table as well. While Assassination tunnels better than anyone and Outlaw is the undisputed champion of sustained AoE, Subtlety bridges the gap between the two, providing very competitive damage in both areas. 
			</p>
			<p>
					As a specialization, Subtlety is somewhat unconventional. Much of the rotation involves actively shifting between two stances, in and out of Stealth. Some abilities can be used at anytime, however, certain abilities can only be used while you are in Stealth. There are only a limited number of ways to activate Stealth during combat, and therefore the core component of this specialization revolves around managing your abilities to correctly time windows of burst.
