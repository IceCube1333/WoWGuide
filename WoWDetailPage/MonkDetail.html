				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression. 
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Whatever their combat role, monks rely mainly on their hands and feet to do the talking, and on strong connection with their inner chi to power their abilities. Abilities such as Expel Harm and Chi Wave both heal their allies while at the same time damaging their enemies.

</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Brewmaster</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>The Brewmaster is the tanking specialisation of Monks, and they are a unique tank. Brewmasters do not rely very much on avoiding damage through dodging and parrying attacks. Instead, have an additional way of dealing with incoming damage, an ability called Stagger, which causes part of the damage to be done to the Monk instantly, while the rest is done over the course of 10 seconds (with the possibility for the Monk to remove part of the non-instant damage).
<p>
Mainly for these reasons, Brewmasters benefit from a steady and relatively easily-healed damage intake. They make excellent tanks in player versus environment (PvE) and will always be a valuable asset to your raid.

			<h4><b><ins>Windwalker</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>The Windwalker specialisation has strong priority target damage, very good area of effect (AoE) damage, and smooth rotations. It is a build up and spend spec, consisting of building up chi and then using it to deal massive amounts of damage.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Mistweaver</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>The Mistweaver specialisation is versatile, and different talent choices can allow it to fit the requirements of the raid very well. Mistweavers can, therefore, heal both tanks and the raid very well.
			</p>
			<p>
While they can perform both tank and raid healing roles, Mistweavers struggle to cover both roles at the same time. This is due to the fact that making extensive use of both Enveloping Mist (for single target) and Essence Font (for AoE) proves too costly to be able to sustain from a Mana perspective.
