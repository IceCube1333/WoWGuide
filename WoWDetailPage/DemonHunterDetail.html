				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Demon hunters, disciples of Illidan Stormrage, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and enemies alike. The Illidari embrace fel and chaotic magics—energies that have long threatened the world of Azeroth—believing them necessary to challenge the Burning Legion. Wielding the powers of demons they’ve slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow elves.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Forgoing heavy armor, Demon Hunters capitalize on speed, closing the distance quickly to strike enemies with one-handed weapons. However, Illidari must also use their agility defensively to ensure that battles end favorably.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Vengeance</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>The Vengeance specialisation is the tanking Demon Hunter specialisation. It is the newest tanking specialisation in World of Warcraft, having been introduced during Legion pre-expansion patch.
					<p>Demon Hunters are the kings of mobility in raids. With double jump and Infernal Strike Icon Infernal Strike, they can get to and fro faster than almost any other class. Additionally, they excel at burst are of effect (AoE) damage, with Soul Cleave Icon Soul Cleave hitting everything in front of them, and even their movement ability deals AoE damage.
				</p>
				<p>Vengeance Demon Hunter gameplay features a mix between healing and damage mitigation, with low-cost and high-uptime active mitigation (reduce damage abilities), the ability to frequently mitigate magic damage, and extremely high burst healing potential.

			<h4><b><ins>Havoc</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Damage)</p>
				<p>Havoc, the DPS spec of the newly introduced Demon Hunter class in Legion is a resource based melee specialization with a focus on Global Cooldown locked gameplay with a builder spender style. It's balanced around your ability to make the most out of your Fury pool and reacting to unpredictable gains whilst using situation specific abilities to push it further. On top of that, it has a number of mobility tools turning it into versatile spec with multiple ways of capitalizing on them.
