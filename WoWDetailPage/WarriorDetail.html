				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. 
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Warriors equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Warriors must carefully master their rage – the power behind their strongest attacks – in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Protection</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>Protection Warriors are very good Tanks. Protection Warriors have excellent mobility during encounters, and shine in fights where there are many enemies (adds). Due to their blocking potential, the damage that they take throughout fights is very smooth and predictable, and easy to heal.

			<h4><b><ins>Arms</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Arms focuses on Colossus Smash. It has a very single-target orientation, tied to small windows of high damage as frequently as possibly by trying to actively reset uses through Tactician.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Fury</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Furys core focus is on Enrage. Boasting very strong sustained damage with frequent burst windows and a robust ability set through talents allowing you to tailor your output for different situations, it is a very powerful and very versatile Melee Specialization.
