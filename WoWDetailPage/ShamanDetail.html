				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman’s allies or punish those who threaten them. 
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>During combat, shaman place damaging and controlling totems on the ground to maximize their effectiveness while hindering their enemies. Shaman are versatile enough to battle foes up close or at range, but wise shaman choose their avenue of attack based on their enemies’ strengths and weaknesses.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Elemental</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>Elemental Shaman is a damage dealing spellcaster with a straightforward but flexible toolkit. While it does not capitalize on any specific niche, Elemental can approach a multitude of environments without feeling compromised. Whether you are questing, powering through dungeons, or zoning into a raid for the first time, this is a spec that always feels like it has a place at the table. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This specialization feels particularly at home when sustained cleave or are of effect (AoE) is present, but not a priority, as Elemental does both very efficiently while maintaining full single target presence. Through talents, Elemental also has access to some potent burst potential, allowing them to surge ahead during damage checks or dungeon bosses.

			<h4><b><ins>Enhancement</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Enhancement Shaman is a specialization that is very flexible and streamlined, with a much faster pace of play to keep you entertained. Enhancement has always been respected for its impressive burst damage and phenomenal sustained are of effect (AoE) damage, it is very well rounded. Enhancement is capable of tackling nearly any fight type without feeling overwhelmed, and feels equally at home in both dungeons and raids.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Restoration</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>Restoration Shaman is an extremely flexible specialization that truly shines when healing groups of players that are clumped together. They have a variety of unique tools to deal with large influxes of damage, such as Spirit Link Totem and Cloudburst Totem, allowing them to trivialize many potentially lethal situations. 
			</p>
					<p>
					They are also unbeatable in situations that force the party or raid to stack up and heal through constant, heavy incoming damage, due to the efficiency of their abilities. Restoration is typically undeterred by high movement due to Spiritwalker's Grace and a variety of instant cast heals and totems. Restoration Shamans are also capable of putting out a respectable amount of damage when necessary, allowing them to assist with pushing tight damage checks and bursting down high priority adds.
