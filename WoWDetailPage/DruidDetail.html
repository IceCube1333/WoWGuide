				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Druids are versatile combatants, in that they can fulfill nearly every role – healing, tanking, and damage dealing. It’s critical that druids tailor the form they choose to the situation, as each form bears a specific purpose.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Guardian</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>Guardian Druid tanks are currently fairly well balanced, when compared to the other tanking classes, although they are somewhat under-represented. Guardians rely on their high health pools (boosted in part by their Mastery) and the increases to healing received that they benefit from. As such, they take more damage than other tanks, but also have the means to handle this damage and be healed up accordingly.
<p>
As a Guardian Druid, you are relatively equally well suited for single target and area of effect (AoE) tanking.
				</p>
				
				<h4><b><ins>Restoration</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>Restoration Druids specialise in maintaining a steady stream of healing on the raid, which they do primarily through their heal over time spells (HOTS). Restoration Druids also do well when tank healing, provided that they have had a chance to set up their HoTs on the tank ahead of time.
<p>
Outside of using Tranquility, Restoration Druids are not very good at reacting to sudden bursts of damage, nor are they good at snipe-healing individual raid members.
</p>
				<p>
In order to properly play a healing role, you will need more than just class-specific information.

			<h4><b><ins>Feral</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>Fera Druids revolve around keeping up various abilites buffs (friendly helpful abilities) and debuffs (mosty hurtful/damaging abilities towards you or your enemy), while generating combo points and using them on finishing moves.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Balance</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Balance specialisation provides an entertaining and challenging rotation, and it performs very well in terms of both single and multiple target damage per second (DPS).
			</p>
			<p>
Balance Druids shine in multiple target fights due to their ability to multi-Dot (damage over time), and they also have good mobility due to their instant cast spells. However, they are dependent on procs, and do not bring much utility to the raid.
