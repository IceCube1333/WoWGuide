				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. 
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Priests use powerful healing magic to fortify themselves and their allies. They also wield powerful offensive spells from a distance, but can be overwhelmed by enemies due to their physical frailty and minimal armor. Experienced priests carefully balance the use of their offensive powers when tasked with keeping their party alive.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Holy</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>The Holy specialisation allows for smooth and very strong are of effect (AoE) and raid healing, but its single target healing potential is mediocre.
				</p>
<p>
It is also worth noting that Holy Priests are somewhat lacking in the mobility department, although this is not a very serious problem.

			<h4><b><ins>Discipline</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Healer)</p>
				<p>The Discipline specialisation relies on healing players through dealing damage (thanks to the Atonement passive), but also has traditional heals and absorption spells.
					<p>
			Healing through dealing damage allows them to contribute to the raid's DPS while still performing well as a healer. From a strictly healing perspective, Discipline Priests might be below the other healer specialisations, but they compensate for this with the extra DPS they bring.
			</p>
			<p>
Balancing healing and dealing damage can be difficult to master at first, and, Discipline Priests suffer whenever there is no target to attack, making the specialisation quite challenging overall.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Shadow</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Shadow specialisation is currently able to deal medium to medium-high single target damage and high sustained multi-damage over time (DoT) damage. It presents players with a complex rotation that is very challenging but can also be very rewarding.
			</p>
			<p>
The Shadow Priest playstyle is very reliant on damage of time spells (DoTs), and this means that they also do very well in situations where they can multi-DoT several targets.
