				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p> When the Lich Kingâ€™s control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Death Knights engage their foes up-close, supplementing swings of their weapons with dark magic that renders enemies vulnerable or damages them with unholy power. They drag foes into one-on-one conflicts, compelling them to focus their attacks away from weaker companions. To prevent their enemies from fleeing their grasp, death knights must remain mindful of the power they call forth from runes, and pace their attacks appropriately.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Blood</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Tank)</p>
				<p>The Blood specialisation relies on dodging and parrying attacks (as they cannot block them) and on self-healing. In fact, due to this ability to routinely self-heal using Death Strike, Blood Death Knights are surprisingly self-sufficient.
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition to self-healing, Blood Death Knights also have a high number of defensive cooldowns to use throughout the fight, leading to the player having a very active role. This means that mastering the specialisation is particularly important in order to have a smooth damage intake.</p>

			<h4><b><ins>Frost</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>The Frost specialisation (which now only allows for dual-wielding One-Handed Weapons) provides reasonable single target and area of effect damage. Focusing on moves like Howling Blast to do a lot of area of effect (AOE) damage.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Unholy</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage & Pets)</p>
				<p>The Unholy specialisation provides a much stronger single target damage and area of effect damage then Frost. It also focuses heavily on the use of a minion/pet through the use of cooldown abilities to strength a minion and to summon minions. Unlike Frost this class wields 2-handed weapons in battle.
