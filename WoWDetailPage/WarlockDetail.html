				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>In the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is their aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon demonic minions to fight beside them. At first, they command only the service of imps, but as a warlock’s knowledge grows, seductive succubi, loyal voidwalkers, and horrific felhunters join the dark sorcerer’s ranks to wreak havoc on anyone who stands in their master’s way. 
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Warlocks burn and destroy weakened foes with a combination of crippling illnesses and dark magic. While their demon pets protect and enhance them, warlocks strike at their enemies from a distance. As physically weak spellcasters bereft of heavy armor, cunning warlocks allow their minions to take the brunt of enemy attacks in order to save their own skin.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Demonology</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage & Pets)</p>
				<p>Demonology Warlocks command hordes of demons to unleash on anyone foolish enough to cross our path. 
						</p>
				<p>
					Demonology is a very procedural specialization that focuses on sustained damage, though it can deal some impressive burst area of effect (AoE) through the use of certain talents. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Demonology Warlocks have high personal survivability, which makes them ideal for progression encounters as it is rare that any damage will take you by surprise. Like all Warlocks, Demonology brings the Demonic Gateway, which can be an invaluable raid cooldown.

			<h4><b><ins>Affliction</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>Affliction Warlocks excel at sustaining high single-target and multiple-target damage. Most of your damage comes from the application of harmful damage over time effects (DoTs). This allows them to effectively cleave on targets that are spread around an area, something many specializations struggle with or are flat out unable to do. 
			</p>
			<p>
					Just like the other Warlock specializations, Affliction Warlocks bring the Demonic Gateway ability to the raid, which can be an invaluable mobility cooldown.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Destruction</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>Destruction Warlock is the most flexible of the Warlock specializations, able to bring to bear a wide variety of damage archetypes to fit the situation. This specialization provides exceptionally strong and efficient 2 target cleave and is not particularly gear reliant to pump out meaningful numbers. 
			</p>
			<p>
					Like all Warlock specializations, Destruction brings Demonic Gateway, a powerful raid cooldown that can transport your entire group 40 yards instantly. Destruction is typically the ideal progression candidate due to its flexibility and its ability to quickly burn down high priority targets with ease.
