				<h3><b><ins>Lore</ins></b></h3>
				<p>From an early age, the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of their environment, they are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies.
				</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Class Info</ins></b></h3>
				<p>Hunters battle their foes at a distance, commanding their pets to attack while they nock their arrows and fire their guns. Though their missile weapons are effective at short and long ranges, hunters are also highly mobile. They can evade or restrain their foes to control the arena of battle.</p>
				<h3><b><ins>Specializations</ins></b></h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4><b><ins>Beast Mastery</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>Beast Mastery focuses on long ranged damage with a heavy focus on pet usage. You spend a lot of time powering up your pet. 
				</p>
				<p>The Beast Mastery specialization brings decent single target damage, extremely strong AoE, has high mobility, and is easy to play.
				</p>

			<h4><b><ins>Marksmanship</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Ranged Damage)</p>
				<p>The Marksmanship specialization is excellent at both single-target and multi-target. It is able to do its full are or effect (AoE) damage potential while simultaneously maximizing its single-target damage. The spec's damage scales incredibly quickly with multiple targets. Marksmanship has high mobility and remains quite good at bursting down high-priority targets. Marksmanship scales excellently with weapon damage, and generally benefits more from good gear than the other two specs.
				</p>
			
				<h4><b><ins>Survival</ins></b></h4>
				<p>(Melee Damage)</p>
				<p>It brings the most utility out of the Hunter specs, and it has strong single-target, at the expense of are of effect (AoE damage), which suffers. Survival is able to set up windows of immense burst damage. Getting the most out of Survival can be quite difficult, especially for Hunters who have been ranged for a long time.
